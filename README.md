# CPPReboot

Welcome to **CPPReboot**! This repository is designed to be a comprehensive, beginner-friendly resource for those returning to C++. It features a collection of well-commented code examples organized into specific folders to refresh core concepts efficiently.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

- **Organized Topics:** The code is divided into folders based on topics I personally deemed suitable. Although files might share names due to the order in which I learned them, they are grouped according to their use cases.
- **Detailed Comments:** Extensive comments are provided to explain concepts in detail. Feel free to skim through them if needed. Please be patient with any grammatical errors as they were written quickly. The comments should be understandable based on the context.
- **File Grouping:** Some comments are divided across multiple files, especially for class-based assignments. In such cases, comments will reference related files and their headers. Ensure you check these references for a complete understanding.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- **Beginner-Friendly:** Ideal for those new to C++ with detailed, explanatory comments.
- **Quick Refresher:** Perfect for those who have prior C++ knowledge and want a rapid review.
- **Structured Learning:** Organized content to help you navigate and revisit concepts effectively.

## Reference
- These files were written by documenting what was being taught by Extern Code in one of his video. The link to the video is as follows: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUQZ1qmKlLY&ab_channel=ExternCode

Feel free to explore and utilize these resources to enhance your C++ skills. For any questions or feedback, don't to reach out to me as I am sleep-deprived and don't care. Haha JK, happy coding!
